    <ul>
        <li>300 g (10 oz) of coarsely ground beef</li>
        <li>150 g (5 oz) of sliced pancetta (you can replace pancetta with minced pork)</li>
        <li>300 g of tomato passata or crashed peeled tomato</li>
        <li>1 small carrot </li>
        <li>1 celery stalk</li>
        <li>1 small onion </li>
        <li>100 ml of dry white wine </li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil </li>
        <li>fine salt </li>
        <li>100 ml of whole milk</li>
        <li>300 ml of meat broth</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil</li>


    </ul>

    <h2>Cooking instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>cut the carrot, celery and onion in very tiny pieces. Then cut the pancetta
            as finely as possible and place the minced pancetta in a saucepan.
            Cook on medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring with a wooden spoon from time to time.</li>
        <li>Add the extra virgin olive oil and the finely chopped vegetables. Stir and cook over medium heat for 5
            minutes, stirring. Then add the ground beef.</li>
        <li>Stir and cook for 5 minutes over medium / high heat. Now put the heat on high and add the white wine. Stir
            and let it evaporate.</li>
        <li>Finally add the tomato passata. Cover with a lid and simmer over LOW heat for about 2 hours. </li>
        <li>In a saucepan, melt the butter over low heat then add the flour - using a flour sieve - while mixing QUICKLY
            with a whisk. Cook for 30 sec/1 min stirring, so the flour becomes tastier and absorb the butter fats.</li>
        <li>Pour the milk slowly over the roux, while stirring vigorously with a whisk to prevent the formation of
            lumps. When the milk is completely poured over the roux sauce, put the saucepan back on low heat. Keep
            mixing constantly, until you have a fairly thick consistency (about 10/15 minutes). The sauce is ready when
            it sticks to the back of a wooden spoon. Finally, add a pinch of fine salt and grated nutmeg to taste.</li>
        <li> Preheat the oven at 190° (380 F). Spread on the bottom of a baking dish (better ceramic or pirex) two
            tablespoons of bechamel. Then put a lasagna noodle over it, trying to cover the entire bottom of the pan. If
            one lasagna is not enough for you, use another one, whole or in half, depending on the size of the lasagna.
            Layer on two tablespoons of bolognese sauce and two of bechamel sauce.</li>
        <li>With the help of a tablespoon, cover the entire surface of the lasagna. In the end, sprinkle two tablespoons
            of grated Parmigiano.</li>
        <li>Repeat these steps for at least five layers (lasagna - bolognese sauce - bèchamel - parmigiano), in any case
            up to fill your baking dish.</li>
        <li>Finish by covering the last layer with plenty of Parmigiano cheese, that cooking make a crispy crust. Bake
            at 190° (380 F) for about 30 minutes.Let cool Lasagna Bolognese out of the oven for 10 minutes before
            serving.</li>
